'''
Problem:
- Input:
    - Long string containing multiple sentences 
- Output:
    - longest sentence in a string based on number of words
    - print number of words in the longest sentence

Data Structures:
- list to store the sentences
- dictionary to store the sentence and length
- maybe just a loop to update the longest sentence 

Algorithm:
- split the string into a list of sentences by splitting based on punctuation (make sure to include punctuation)
- store the length and index of each string in a dictionary 
- return the string with the longest string and length count
